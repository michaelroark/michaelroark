- Hi, I’m @michaelroark
- I’m someone who has has dabbled in a number of fields.  I have studied Industrial-Organizational Psychology.  I currently work as a bus monitor and I am trying to develop myself as a data analyst.
- I’m currently learning R, Tableau, and SQL.
- If you have feedback for me or are interested in working with me, you can reach me at michaelmroark@gmail.com


-So, I spend a lot more time on applications and learning than on projects for my portfolio, so I don't get over here as much as I would like to.  I am going to upload the absolute mess of stuff I made for myself for my capstone project.  It was not designed for anyone but me, so it's quite unprofessional.  However, if someone wants to know how I think, this may give some insights.  I am down for feedback on my work, but please be gentle on the capstone project.  Anything I upload here in the future will be designed to be looked at, but for now I am trying to just make progress on actually putting things over here.  Thanks.

-Second Update, I am going to start doing projects and contests at a projected rate of one a month.  I will be uploading my work here.
